                    <h2> What is Whoops N Hoops </h3>
                    <p>Whoops and Hoops is an arcade drone simulation built with OpenGL which replicates real life drone 
                    physics while keeping the arcade feel. The game currently includes <strong>realistic drone
                        controlls via controller/radio reciever input, realisitic collision, and trick detection</strong>.

                    <p>There is very minimal keyboard input(there is none), so a controller is highly recommended.
                    Plug in any recognizable controller by your system and it should work. As of now I have only
                    tested an Xbox One controller and the Radiomaster Pocket.</p>
                    <p>The controls can take a while to get down and there is no way to tweak your rates without editing
                    code so the best advice I could give is move each stick with really good precision slowly (:. Hopefully
                    this diagram helps for getting controlls right.</p>

                <h2>Motivation and Inspiration </h2>
                <p>The main inspiration to make a drone arcade game came from old games like <strong>Jet Set Radio & the Tony Hawk skateboarding games</strong>.
                The aesthetic of the entire game was heavily inspired by Jet Set Radio which most of the textures came from :p. Flying drones
                is a fun hobby, and I noticed that most current sims on the market take the realistic approach and none have dived deeper into 
                the arcade feel, especially for the community that is involved with freestyleing. The term <strong>whoop</strong> just refers to a smaller drone usually
                in sizes ranging from 65mm to 85mm. They are known for being flown for different styles, including racing and <strong>freestyle</strong>. This game
                focuses more on the freestyling approach to flying, but racing modes could be added in the future. I tried to mimic the feel
                of flying my air65 drone in real life, but there is still definitely some tweaking to be done...</p>

                <h3> Controller Support </h3>
                <!-- controller support-->
                <p>Controller support was possible due to the GLFW library, which allows you to
                detect and poll gamepad inputs. The library is very well documented, so I was
                able to add support for both gamepads, like Xbox and PS4 controllers, along with
                support for actual drone transmitters. To give a rough idea of how this was done
                I first polled the joystick locations, where each axis for each stick is mapped to
                the range of -1 to 1. With these values, I could then map them to the yaw, pitch, 
                and roll of the drone along with the thrust for the left stick y-axis, which I would have
                to clamp to 0-1. Later, I hope to also poll the controller buttons to allow for other 
                functionality like disarming/arming the drone, pausing, and anything else I can think of.

                <h3> Drone Physics </h3>
                <!-- Custom Drone Physics-->
                <p> As cool as custom drone physics sounds, the process was very straightforward when
                it came to the forces acting on the drone, while I admit some of it was magic to me due
                to the abstraction that the glm library does for <a href="https://eater.net/quaternions">quaternions</a>. The Drone is a struct that
                holds all of its methods to either update position, orientation, or trick state along with
                every attribute like thrust, gravity, mass, etc. The two main things that were neeeded to 
                have realistic drone movement was orientation and position. Starting with position, I
                simulated two forces acting on the drone: thrust and gravity. With these two forces and the
                mass of the drone acceleration could be calculated. After acceleration was calculated we could
                use delta time to find velocity and likewise position.

            <div class="longbox" style="margin-top: -45px">
                <p> Moving on to orientation, I decided to use quaternions to handle the rotations of the drone
                since I was running into problems when just using euler angles alone plus I found that glm
                has a header file that makes using them really simple. The drones update orientation would take
                the mapped pitch, yaw, and roll values create seperate quaternions for each axis to then alter
                the current rotation quaternion for the drone.

                    <h3>AAB and OBB boxes</h3>
                    <!--AABB & OBB boxes-->
                    <p>For the <a href="https://tutorialedge.net/gamedev/aabb-collision-detection-tutorial/">AABB(Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes)</a> I created a class which handled the construction
                    given a min and max corner. After the data structure was covered along with the needed methods
                    to calculate if two boxes intersect for collision, I made it so that when objects were loaded 
                    in via the tinyobj loader they also were packed together with the these AABB objects as well. So,
                    when I would draw the model it would have its bounding box attribute which I could also check
                    for collision against drone.</p>

                <div class="box">
                    <p>Regarding the OBB, I would say that the implementation went over my head and it doesn't entirelly work
                    properly with collision between the OBB and AABB data structures because there was a lot of workarounds I went through.
                    So I'll leave it to you to figure out how I can fix it (:</p>

                <h3>Trick Detection</h3>
                <p>To give a rough idea of what went behind getting the trick detection semi-working, there were three main 
                steps in tracking the drone's orientation for tricks. First, I would create another method within the drone
                struct for trick detection, which would be called on every frame. This function would calculate the delta angles 
                for the orientation quaternion, which was easily done via a library function within glm. With these values, I could then keep track of the accumulation of each change in angle so that once a full rotation was done in either axis,
                a trick would be detected. I ran into the issue of having tricks constantly being detected due to there being no 
                threshold on when the drone's delta angles were calculated, so I introduced a minimum threshold for each angle that must
                be exceeded before the trick would count. I also added a timer that starts, so the trick would have to be done within
                a certain time limit. Other than the main logistics of tracking the tricks, a lot of the other work that went in was
                just a bunch of conditional checks, which could probably be done better..</p>
